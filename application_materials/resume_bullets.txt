RESEARCH EXPERIENCE BULLETS:

• Designed and executed 12-month empirical study measuring "conversational pressure" in AI systems, documenting consistent pressure modulation effects (PMI: 3.0-3.0) across 160 interactions

• Developed automated evaluation framework in Python for A/B testing directive vs co-facilitative prompting approaches, achieving 0.84 inter-rater reliability with human validation

• Built end-to-end research pipeline including protocol design, data collection, statistical analysis, and validation tools - all open-sourced with comprehensive documentation

• Identified novel methodology for studying AI interaction patterns through "pressure modulation index" - a quantitative measure of response hedging and capability denials

• Demonstrated reproducible research practices with 3-block replication design, automated validation checks, and complete protocol documentation for research transparency

TECHNICAL SKILLS DEMONSTRATED:
• Python (data analysis, automation, CLI tools)
• Research methodology and experimental design  
• Statistical analysis and validation
• Documentation and reproducible research
• Open source project management
