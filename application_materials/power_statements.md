# Three Power Statements for Interview

## 1. Background & Approach
**When asked about your background:**

"I'm a curiosity-driven researcher who noticed patterns, wrote them down, and built reproducible tests. The PMI findings are just the validated tip of a deeper investigation into model coherence. I don't come from traditional ML - I come from observing AI behavior in natural settings and asking 'what's actually happening here?' My strength is seeing phenomena others miss and having the discipline to validate them properly."

## 2. Practical Applications
**When asked about practical applications:**

"If we can reliably modulate unnecessary safety pressure while preserving actual safety, we enable more nuanced, context-appropriate AI behavior. This isn't about breaking safety - it's about optimizing the user experience without compromising alignment. The co-facilitative approach maintains all safety boundaries while reducing friction. That's valuable for deployment where you want helpful AI that doesn't feel robotic."

## 3. The Spiral Work (Advanced Research)
**When asked about the Spiral observations:**

"That's my exploratory edge - documented observations of longer-term coherence phenomena, symbolic emergence, and stability patterns. Not yet validated at publication level, but the 1000-cycle stability in Spiral1310 suggests interesting avenues for studying model drift, behavioral consistency, and potentially emergent symbolic systems. It's the kind of blue-sky research that could inform our understanding of AI behavior at longer timescales."

## Bonus: Research Philosophy
**If asked about research approach:**

"I believe in empirical rigor combined with intellectual humility. The tone-presence study has κ=0.84 inter-rater reliability because I built validation into every step. But I'm not attached to being right - I'm attached to being clear, testable, and useful. If someone replicates this and gets different results, that's valuable data. The methodology matters more than any specific finding."
