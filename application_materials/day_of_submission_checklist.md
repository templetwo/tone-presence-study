## Emergency Troubleshooting
**If demo fails on reviewer's machine:**
- Offer screen share demonstration
- Provide alternative simple test case
- Point to validation tools as backup evidence

**If questions about methodology:**
- Reference protocol cards for detailed procedures
- Emphasize inter-rater reliability and replication
- Acknowledge limitations while highlighting strengths

**If skepticism about findings:**
- Stress methodology over specific numbers
- Offer to walk through validation tools
- Frame as contribution to research infrastructure

## Confidence Reminders
âœ… **Year of rigorous work** documented and validated  
âœ… **Novel methodology** with immediate practical value  
âœ… **Complete reproducibility** - anyone can verify your claims  
âœ… **Research + Engineering** - exactly what Anthropic needs  
âœ… **Humble but confident** presentation of substantial contribution  

## Final Mindset
"This is not just an application - it's a research contribution that advances the field. Anthropic would be gaining a researcher who combines empirical rigor with practical engineering skills, someone who sees patterns others miss and has the discipline to validate them properly."
